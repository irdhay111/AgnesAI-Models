Official gateway and model catalog for Agnes AI.

Agnes AI gives developers OpenAI-compatible access to multimodal models for text, image, video, and agent workflows through a unified API gateway.

## About Agnes AI

Agnes AI is a frontier AI company focused on full-modality foundation models. We train models in-house across text, image, video, and reasoning. Our mission is to make high-quality AI more accessible, scalable, and easy to plug into any product or platform.

Our model suite features high-precision models ranked on PinchBench and is purpose-built to power agentic tools such as OpenClaw and Hermes. Alongside text-to-image, image-to-image, and image-to-video models, it delivers cinematic-quality visuals, synchronized audio-visual generation, and fast performance for seamless creation, transformation, and deployment of rich AI-generated content.

## Python Quick Start

Install the example dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export AGNES_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Run a streaming chat completion:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="YOUR_AGNES_API_KEY",
    base_url="https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1",
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="agnes-2.5-flash",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short intro to Agnes AI."}
    ],
    stream=True,
)

for chunk in response:
    delta = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
    if delta:
        print(delta, end="")
```

## Chat Example

```bash
curl https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGNES_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "agnes-2.0-flash",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Explain how to integrate an OpenAI-compatible API gateway."
      }
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'
```

## Image Example

```bash
curl https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1/images/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGNES_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "agnes-image-2.1-flash",
    "prompt": "A luminous floating city above a misty canyon at sunrise, cinematic realism",
    "size": "1024x768"
  }'
```

## Video Example

```bash
curl -X POST https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1/videos \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGNES_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "agnes-video-v2.0",
    "prompt": "A cinematic shot of a cat walking on the beach at sunset, soft ocean waves, warm golden lighting, realistic motion",
    "height": 768,
    "width": 1152,
    "num_frames": 121,
    "frame_rate": 24
  }'
```

Video generation is asynchronous. Create a task first, then query the result with the returned `video_id`.

```text
GET https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/agnesapi?video_id=<VIDEO_ID>
```

Use `video_id` for video result polling. Do not use `task_id` for current video result queries unless a specific legacy workflow explicitly requires it.

## Common Integration Notes

- Use `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` for every request.
- Keep API keys in server-side environment variables. Never expose keys in client-side code or public repositories.
- `agnes-2.5-flash` is fully available to users with Agnes API access. It is OpenAI-compatible with `agnes-2.0-flash`: the base URL, endpoint, request format, streaming, tool calling, and image URL input stay the same. Current public reference: `512K` context and `65.5K` maximum output. Availability, rate limits, and billing are determined by account and API key permissions.
- `agnes-2.0-flash` currently supports a `256K` context window and `64K` max output reference limit after the June 2026 rollback from the temporary `1M` context window.
- Thinking mode, streaming, tool calling, and vision inputs are supported on compatible chat workflows. Check the model-specific docs before enabling advanced parameters in production.
- For `400` responses, verify required parameters, request body shape, image URL accessibility, and response format placement.
- For `401` responses, verify the API key, bearer token format, account status, and environment variable loading.
- For `429` responses, reduce concurrency, add retry with backoff, and check the current plan-level RPM limit.
- For `500`, `502`, `503`, or `520` responses, retry with exponential backoff and inspect whether the request payload can be simplified.

## Security

Never commit API keys, tokens, `.env` files, screenshots containing secrets, or private data.

Use environment variables for local development:

```bash
export AGNES_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
